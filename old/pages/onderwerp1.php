<p class="information">The Super Mario Bros. Movie is an upcoming computer-animated fantasy film based on the Nintendo video game franchise Mario. Produced by Illumination with financing from Universal Pictures and Nintendo, and distributed by Universal, it is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (in the latter's feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel. The ensemble voice cast includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, Charles Martinet, and Kevin Michael Richardson.

After the critical and commercial failure of the 1993 live-action Mario film, Nintendo became reluctant to license its intellectual properties for film adaptations. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto became interested in developing another film when Nintendo was bringing its older games to the Virtual Console service, and through Nintendo's work with Universal Parks & Resorts to create Super Nintendo World, he met Illumination founder Chris Meledandri. By 2016, the two were discussing a Mario film and, in January 2018, Nintendo announced that it would collaborate with Illumination and Universal to produce it. Production was underway by 2020, and the cast was publicly announced in September 2021.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled for release in the United States on April 5, 2023, and in Japan on April 28.</p>
